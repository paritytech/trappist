# Asset Trap Pallet

## Overview

Note: the name of this pallet has **nothing** to do with the name of the project (Trappist). They just sound alike as a coincidence.

In the [third blogpost of his XCM series](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-part-iii-execution-and-error-management-ceb8155dd166), Dr. Gavin Wood describes his vision for an XCM **Asset Trap** & **Claim** system:

> ### ðŸª¤ The Asset Trap
> When errors occur during programs that deal with assets (as most do since they will often need to pay for their execution with `BuyExecution`), then it can be very problematic. There may be instances where the `BuyExecution` instruction itself results in error, perhaps because the weight limit was incorrect or the assets used for payment were insufficient. Or perhaps an asset gets sent to a chain which cannot deal with it in a useful way. In these cases, any many others, the messageâ€™s XCVM execution finishes with assets remaining in the Holding Register, which like the other registers are transient and we would expect to be forgotten about.
>
> Teams and their users will be happy to know that Substrateâ€™s XCM allows chains to avoid this loss entirely ðŸŽ‰. The mechanism works in two steps. First, any assets in the Holding Register when it gets cleared do not get completely forgotten. If the Holding Register is not empty when the XCVM halts, then an event is emitted containing three pieces of information: the value of the Holding Register; the original value of the Origin Register; and the hash of these two pieces of information. Substrateâ€™s XCM system then places this hash in storage. This part of the mechanism is called the Asset Trap.
> 
> ### ðŸŽŸ The Claim System
> 
> The second step to the mechanism is being able to claim some previous contents of the Holding Register. This actually happens not through anything specially designed for this purpose but rather through a general purpose instruction that we have not yet met called `ClaimAsset`.

The XCM Executor Config (`XcmConfig`) expects two specific types:
- `AssetTrap`: which must implement the [`DropAssets`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/1a034bd6de0e76721d19aed02a538bcef0787260/xcm/xcm-executor/src/traits/drop_assets.rs#L24) trait.
- `AssetClaims`: which must implement the [`ClaimAssets`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/1a034bd6de0e76721d19aed02a538bcef0787260/xcm/xcm-executor/src/traits/drop_assets.rs#L64) trait.

### Default Implementation

The [`pallet-xcm`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/xcm/pallet-xcm) available on the `polkadot` repository provides a default implementation for both of these traits. It calculates a hash of `(origin, versioned_assets)` and uses this hash as a key for a `StorageMap`, where the value is a counter of how many times these assets have been trapped. For the claiming part, it takes a `ticket` which helps it figure out the version, and if the calculated hash of `(origin, versioned_assets)` (claimer's origin and claimed assets) matches a key on the `StorageMap`, it decreases the counter (or cleans it up) while loading the assets back into the Holding Register.

This default implementation is arguably opaque from the user's perspective. The user cannot query the chain-state to get any information about the trapped assets, since only a hash and a counter are written into storage. Their only way of getting some insight is by looking at the event emitted at the time when the assets are trapped.

### Opinionated Implementation

`pallet-asset-trap` provides an alternative (and opinionated) approach for trapping and claiming assets. We traded off a relatively more complex implementation for a more transparent and intuitive user experience. A few design decisions differ from the default implementation, namely:
- There's no hashing. The key for the `StorageMap` is set as the trapped assets' origin. The `StorageMap` value is a `BoundedVec<TrappedAssets, T::MaxTrapsPerOrigin>`, where `TrappedAssets` is a new `struct` is used to keep track of the trapped assets.
- The assets to be trapped are checked. Non-compliant assets will not be trapped (they're lost forever). The asset will be trapped if (and only if):
    - It is Trappist's Native Token (`HOP`) OR some derivative asset previously registered in `pallet-asset-registry` (e.g.: `txUSD`).
    - The amount is bigger than the token's minimum balance (a.k.a. existential deposit).

After the asset is trapped, the user can query storage with the origin's `MultiLocation`, getting back an array of `TrappedAssets` items, each of which shows the following details:
- `multi_assets`: a `VersionedMultiAssets`, which holds all the necessary information about the trapped assets.
- `n`: a `u32` counting how many times `multi_assets` has been trapped.

The array used as the `StorageMap`'s value is a `BoundedVec`. That ensures that some origin cannot trap assets indefinitely. After the `MaxTrapsPerOrigin` limit is reached, the oldest traps are discarded, and the assets are lost forever.

### Limitations

This implementation has time complexity `O(N)` for trapping and claiming, while `pallet-xcm` is `O(1)`.

## Configuration

### Types
* `RuntimeEvent` â€“ The overarching event type.
* `Balances` â€“ The balances type implemented by `pallet-balances`.
* `Assets` â€“ The assets type implemented by `pallet-assets`.
* `AssetRegistry` â€“ The asset registry type implemented by `pallet-asset-registry`.
* `MaxTrapsPerOrigin` â€“ Upper limit on how many traps will be held for some specific origin.

## Extrinsics

This pallet does not provide any extrinsic.

## How to add `pallet-asset-trap` to a runtime

### Runtime's `Cargo.toml`

Add `pallet-asset-trap`, to the dependencies:
```toml
[dependencies.pallet-asset-trap]
version = "0.0.1"
default-features = false
git = "https://github.com/paritytech/trappist.git"
branch = "master"
```

Make sure `pallet-balances`, `pallet-assets`, `pallet-asset-registry` and `xcm-primitives` are also there.

Update the runtime's `std` feature:
```toml
std = [
    # --snip--
    "pallet-asset-trap/std",
    # --snip--
]
```

### Runtime's `lib.rs`

Here's how to configure `pallet-asset-trap`:
```
impl pallet_asset_trap::Config for Test {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type Balances = Balances;
    type Assets = Assets;
    type AssetMultiLocationGetter = AssetRegistry;
    type MaxTrapsPerOrigin = ConstU32<X>;
}
```

where `X` is the value you want to use for `MaxTrapsPerOrigin`.

Also, `Balances` is `pallet_balances`, `Assets` is `pallet_assets`, and `AssetRegistry` is `pallet_asset_registry` on the `construct_runtime` macro call:

```rust
construct_runtime!(
    pub enum Runtime where
        // --snip--
    {
        // --snip---
        System: frame_system,
        Balances: pallet_balances,
        Assets: pallet_assets,
        AssetRegistry: pallet_asset_registry,
        AssetTrap: pallet_asset_trap,
        // --snip---
    }
);
```

### Runtime's `xcm_config.rs`

Make sure the `AssetTrap` and `AssetClaims` types are both set as `AssetTrap` type for `XcmConfig`:
```rust
pub struct XcmConfig;
impl xcm_executor::Config for XcmConfig {
    // snip
    type AssetTrap = AssetTrap;
    type AssetClaims = AssetTrap;
    // snip
}
```
